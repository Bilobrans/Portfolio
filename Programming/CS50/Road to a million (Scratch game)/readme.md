## **The Road to a Million 💰**

This project was developed as part of Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science. It is a clicker game designed to challenge the player's strategic thinking and resource management


## **🚀 The Game**

The goal is simple: start with $0 and reach $1,000,000.

## **Key Features:**

Work Mechanics: Start by taking freelance Excel jobs to earn your first dollars.

Upgrades: Invest your earnings to increase profit margins and speed up your activities.

Risk vs. Reward: A random encounter offers a 49% chance to double your money or lose everything. Be careful: you can only accept this offer 3 times per run!

Winning: Reach the million-dollar mark to claim your trophy.

## **🧠 Technical Insight**

While the interface is simple, the backend logic involves:

Variables Management: Tracking real-time balance and upgrade multipliers.

Conditional Logic: Managing the "Double or Nothing" probability and usage limits.

Game Loops: Ensuring the progression and speed of tasks feel rewarding.

Here are some pictures of the programming logic used:
