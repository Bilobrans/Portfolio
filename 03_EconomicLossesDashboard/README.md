# 📊 Economic Losses Dashboard — Excel

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Confidential_Data-Fictionalized-blue)

## 🧩 Overview
This project presents an **interactive Excel dashboard** developed to analyze and visualize **economic losses caused by quality issues** in the company’s production process.  
The tool allows users to explore data dynamically — filtering by product, date, and production stage — to identify which areas of the process generate the greatest financial impact.

⭐ *This project demonstrates my ability to translate production data into clear, actionable visual insights using Excel dashboards and automation.*

## ⭐ Methodology: STAR

### **Situation**
The company faced difficulties in **quantifying and understanding financial losses** due to quality issues in production.  
Although data were collected daily, they were dispersed across several spreadsheets, making it difficult for management to visualize the real cost of production inefficiencies.

---

### **Task**
My responsibility was to:
- **Develop a single, consolidated dashboard** to monitor losses due to quality issues;  
- Enable **interactive analysis** by product, date, and process stage;  
- Present **key indicators** in a clear and visual way to support decision-making;  
- Maintain **confidentiality** by ensuring no sensitive company data was exposed.

---

### **Action**
I designed and built an **interactive Excel dashboard** using dynamic tables, and advanced formulas.  
The dashboard allows users to select:
- The **product** being analyzed;  
- The **date** of production data;  
- The **stage of the production process**.

Upon selection, the following visuals are automatically updated:

#### 🔄 Interactive Charts
1. **% of Data Collections by Classification**  
   - *First Line:* high-quality products  
   - *Rework:* items needing correction  
   - *Scrap:* defective items discarded  
   - *Second Line:* below-average quality  

2. **Quantity of Data Collections by Production Stage**  
   - Shows how often data were collected in each stage.  

3. **Classification by Production Stage**  
   - Highlights which steps have higher quality deviations.  

#### 📉 Static Charts
These visuals remain fixed to provide a broader financial overview:
- **Monthly financial loss per stage — Product 1**  
- **Monthly financial loss per stage — Product 2**  
- **Monthly financial loss per stage — Product 3**

This structure allowed managers to **identify critical points in the process**, quantify the **financial impact of quality failures**, and **prioritize corrective actions** effectively.

---

### **Result**
The implementation of this dashboard brought several significant outcomes:

- Provided **clear visibility** of losses by product and production stage.  
- Allowed **faster identification of recurring quality problems**, enabling proactive management.  
- Helped the company **quantify the financial impact of poor quality**, strengthening data-driven decision-making.  
- Reduced the time spent on manual analysis and improved communication between production and quality teams.  

⭐ *This project highlights my ability to combine process knowledge, data analysis, and visualization to generate insights that improve operational performance and financial outcomes.*
