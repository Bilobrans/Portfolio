## 🧭 Methodology: STAR

### **Situation**
The company managed several financial spreadsheets across different departments, which made it difficult to consolidate information and obtain a clear view of the business’s financial health.  
Data was fragmented and updated manually, leading to confusion, errors, and a lack of into cash flow.

### **Task**
The goal was to develop a **centralized Power BI dashboard** that could integrate all relevant financial data and present it in a simple, dynamic, and visual way — enabling faster and more reliable decision-making.

### **Action**
I created a financial dashboard in **Power BI** that automatically consolidates key financial metrics from multiple spreadsheets.  
The dashboard includes:
- 💰 **Entries and Expenses Overview**
- 📊 **Cash Balance Tracking**
- 📈 **Monthly Cash Flow Evolution**
- 📅 **Comparative Analysis of Financial Periods**

To ensure data security, I worked with the finance team to structure consistent data sources. 
I also designed intuitive visuals, focusing on quick interpretation of financial indicators.
