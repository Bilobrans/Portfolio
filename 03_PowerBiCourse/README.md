# 📊 Power BI Introductory Course

## 🧩 Overview
This project presents a **Power BI introductory mini-course** that I taught on behalf of the **Junior Enterprise** where I work.  
The goal was to provide participants with a simple and practical introduction to Power BI — covering the fundamentals of data connection, transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation.

The project demonstrates my ability to teach analytical tools and design learning experiences focused on beginners in data visualization.

## ⭐ Methodology: STAR

### **Situation**
The Junior Enterprise identified that many students were interested in learning **data visualization**, but had **no prior experience** with Power BI or BI concepts.  
To promote knowledge sharing and stimulate technical development, we decided to offer a short and accessible workshop.

---

### **Task**
My task was to:
- Design and **teach a mini-course** introducing Power BI from scratch;  
- Create a **simple, guided example dashboard**;  
- Focus on **clear explanations** and **hands-on practice**;  

---

### **Action**
I structured the course in three main stages:

1. **🔗 Data Connection**  
   - Importing datasets from Excel.  
   - Understanding the Power Query Editor interface.  

2. **⚙️ Data Transformation**  
   - Cleaning and formatting data (removing duplicates, fixing headers, adjusting types).  
   - Basic calculations using columns and measures.  

3. **📈 Dashboard Creation**  
   - Building visuals: bar charts, cards, and line charts.  
   - Adding filters and slicers for interactivity.  
   - Designing a clean, minimalistic dashboard layout.  

All steps were explained with **beginner-friendly language** and focused on **practical learning**.  

---

### **Result**
The workshop successfully:
- Students gained their **first hands-on experience** with Power BI, building a functional dashboard from scratch.  
- Many reported that they felt **more confident using data tools** and understood how BI can support real-world decision-making.
